# A single Perceptron
In this chapter i will teach you how to code a single Perceptron in Python with more or the less only the numpy package. Numpy uses a vectorizible math structure in which you can easily calculate elementwise or do stuff like normal matrix multiplications with just a symbol (i always interprete Vectors as one dimensional matrixes!). At the most of the times its just translating math formulars into python code without changing its structure.  
First of all we are starting with the needed parameters, that are explained later:

Number of runs over the training data := `train_n`   
Lerarning rate := $\alpha =$ `alpha`    
Bias value := $\beta :=$ `biasVal`     
and the activation function:  
$$ 
step_0(s)= 
\begin{cases}
    1,& s	\geq 0\\
    0,& s < 0
\end{cases}
$$
or as python code:
```{python}
def step(s):
    if( s >= 0 ):
        return(1)
    else:
        return(0)
```
This should be the easiest activation function to start with.  

The traings dataset is the following:
$$
\left[
\begin{array}{cc|c}
x_i,_1 & x_i,_2 & y_i \\
\end{array}
\right]
$$
$$
\left[
\begin{array}{cc|c}
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1 \\
\end{array}
\right]
$$
If your looking exactly you can see that this is the OR-Gate. Later you will see why these type of problems are the only suitable things to do with a single neuron. The provided traings dataset contains the `X_train` matrix and the `Y_train` matrix.
